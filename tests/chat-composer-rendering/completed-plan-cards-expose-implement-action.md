### Completed plan cards expose implement action

#### Feature/Change Name
Completed plan cards show an `Implement plan` button that turns plan mode off and sends an implementation prompt built from the plan content.

#### Prerequisites/Setup
1. Dev server running at `http://127.0.0.1:4173`
2. An existing thread contains a completed persisted plan card
3. The thread composer is available for follow-up messages

#### Steps
1. Open a thread containing a completed plan card
2. Verify the completed plan card is collapsed by default, then click its header to expand it
3. Verify the expanded plan card shows `Implement plan` at the bottom
4. Click `Implement plan`
5. Confirm the composer thread switches back to default mode
6. Inspect the next `turn/start` request or the resulting assistant behavior

#### Expected Results
- Completed plan cards render the `Implement plan` action even when the plan body is structured as headings/lists instead of checkbox steps
- Completed plan cards remain compact by default while keeping the action available after expansion
- Clicking the button sends a simple implementation follow-up message instead of copying the whole plan body into chat
- The next turn runs in default mode rather than plan mode

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Archive or delete any test thread created only for this check
